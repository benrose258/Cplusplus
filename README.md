# C++

My C++ Files. The files here are classified into a couple different groups.

Classwork (Programming I've done for my classes in C++):

    CS 385 - "Algorithms"
    
    CS 442 - "Database Systems Management"

Personal Projects (Projects that I thought up and coded myself outside of my classes)
